day 7 at DSA 

this is the first time i've been consistent this long to something 

anyways today i learned about 
> Sort 0s 1s and 2s in Linked List
    -> With two approach 
          1. by traversing. 
           -> we do traversing and count the no. of element is present and replace the element 
          2. Replacement is not allowed instead we replaces the links which were connecting the elements
          
> Merge 2 sorted Linked List
with the apporach of case by case
-> Case by case
