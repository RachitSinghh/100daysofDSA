# 100daysofDSA

I am embarking on a 100 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Challenge on Github, where I will be committing to coding for at least two hour every day(minimum) for the next 100 days. The focus of this challenge is to help me become a better programmer by consistently practicing DSA coding and improving my skills using C++.

Throughout the challenge, I plan to work on various DSA coding exercises and problems, ranging from simple to complex ones. I will be sharing my progress on Github, documenting my journey through the challenge, and highlighting the skills I develop along the way.

I believe this challenge will not only help me hone my DSA skills but also boost my productivity, discipline, and confidence as a programmer. I am excited about this challenge and can't wait to see the progress I make over the next 100 days.



**Why C++**

I have chosen C++ as the programming language for this challenge because it is a powerful language for implementing algorithms and data structures. It has a low-level control of memory and efficient operations that can make a difference when working with large data sets. Additionally, many interviewers prefer C++ for coding interviews, making this challenge also a great opportunity to prepare for future job opportunities.
