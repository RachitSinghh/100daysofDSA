Day 5 at 100 days of DSA 

And day 2 on learning Linked List 

I submitted some question of Linked list on Leetcode

-> Reverse linked list 
-> Middle Linked

-> Reverse Linked list in group 
-> check if linked list is circular or not

-> learned about Floyd cycle dectection



the reason i learned Linked in day 5 is I know About Arrays, string,all type of sorting and recursion 
that's why i thought i should learn what i'm currently at instead of starting from the 
begining. I might later revise all the concept but for i'm going 
i even submitted 38 quesiton on leet code
