Its Day 2 at 100 days of DSA 

Today i learned about "Space complexity" second topic in Complexity Analysis.

Also did little bit of revision on Time complexity. 

In Space Complexity i learned. 

   > What is space complexity:
     Space Complexity is am easure of the total memory including the space of input value with respect to the input size, that an algorithm needs to run and produce the 
      Result.
      
   > Auxiliary Space:
        It is a temporary space or extra space used by an algorithm apart from the input size in order to solve a problem. 
      
   > Also did Some MNQs on Code studio
    (Just in case u don't know but Code studio is providing Free certificate on Widely used languages and DSA and list goes on )

     Other than DSA i also learned about Object oriented programming.
     I learned about 
     
     > Class and objects
     > Empty class
     > Access modifiers 
     > getter & setter
     > static & dynamic allocation 
     > contructor >> Parameterised constructor
     > This -> keyword
     > Copy Constructor
     > Shallow & Deep copy
     > Destructor 
     > static Keyword
     > static Function
